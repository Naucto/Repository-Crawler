This assistant will ask you a handful set of questions to install the service
and its components on this computer.

Default values are shown right besides the question. Press Enter if you want
to accept said default value, or type in the appropriate value if necessary.

The service requires the use of SSL certificates so that GitHub can contact it
through a webhook. Consequently, this requires an associated domain name for
this task.

Only change this value if you are not going to use auto-renewed
certification bots like certbot.

We recommend you use certbot to automatically generate keys for your domain
name, and keep them up-to-date.

The path must be a folder containing the following two files:

   - cert.pem, the public key exposed to end users/clients
   - privkey.pem, the private key used to encrypt responses to be decoded by
     end users/clients

As we indirectly use 'git' and 'ssh' by extension, we require the service to
have a SSH private key.

As an Epitech student, you need to generate a public and private key
associated to your user account and authenticated to single sign-on.

Since this is risky, we HIGHLY recommend you to generate a separate key pair,
distinct from your work key pair.

The private key will not be exposed to the users of this machine nor to the
outsiders that use the hosted service through HTTPS.

The service requires write access to the project owner's student repository.
Thus, we need to have a fine-grained GitHub token associated to a student
account.

Creating a fine-grained GitHub token is easy. Follow the guide on the official
GitHub documentation website:

https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token

Make sure to authenticate your fine-grained GitHub token against the official
Epitech organization associated with your account.

The service needs to know from which GitHub organization you want to synchronize
the main student repository to.

You do not need to specify the full URL path to it, only the name/identifier of
that organization. For example, Naucto is located at https://github.com/Naucto,
so we shall specify 'Naucto' for this question.

EOF

path to your repository. For example, if your repository is located at the
following location:

    https://github.com/EpitechPromo2027/G-EIP-600-MPL-6-1-eip-alexis.belmonte

You only need to specify the following path:

You may update or uninstall this service by using this installer script again

this script.
